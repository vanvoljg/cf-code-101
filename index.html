            <h2>Top 5 reasons to have a small pet:</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Small pets are cuter than big pets.</li>
                    <li>Small pets are much more portable. You can take them to the mall and smuggle them across international borders with relative ease.</li>
                    <li>You don't have to tell your landlord about small pets. (Sorry, landlords.)</li>
                    <li>Compared to horses, small pets barely eat anything. Your pet's grocery bill will be much lower than a horse's.</li>
                    <li>In most contests of skill or agility, small pets win.</li>
